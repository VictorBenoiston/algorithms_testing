 <h1>First testing of the algorithms that's gonna act like a base to the project.</h1>
<h2>First algorithm: Item-Item recommender with Collaborative Filtering</h2>
<p>k-nearest neighbour, cosine similarity, collaboratibe filtering</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Second algorithm: Handling the cold start problem with Content-based filtering</h2>
<p>In this one, we used content-based filtering, with a clustering techniques aproach.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
<p>We need to set our parameters, such as 'movies', 'movieId', i.e., 'classType', 'classYear', and so on. Then, the algorithm itself, is already built.</p>
<p>Furthermore, is eligible to get a thrid algorithm test, with implicit feedback, therefore, it's also needed to figure it out what features e.g., 'time browsing', 'class consumption', and so on, to get a more accurate feedback. </p>
